    1. What is Semantic HTML?
	The concept that HTML markup should provide meaning to your content, not its appearance. 	

    2. What is HTML used for?
	HTML is used to create the markup for web pages. 
 
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it?
	An attribute is used to add a heavier specificity to an HTML element, and it is included inside of the opening HTML tag of the element. An example of an attribute is the class selector.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
	The h1 tag is used to wrap the most important headline on a page, and it should really only be used once throughout a page, particularly for search engine utilization. 	


    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
	- The anchor tag, <a>, requires an 'href' attribute.
	- The input tag, <input>, requires a 'type' attribute. 

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
	In the head of an HTML document, you put a <title> element which defines the title of the page, reference external scripts (using <script> elements) and stylesheets (using <link> elements), <meta> elements to specify character sets, page descriptions, keywords, and other metadata including viewport settings, and lastly, the <base> element which defines the default address for all links on the page.

    7. What is an id? 
	An ID is a selector that is only allowed to be used once per HTML page and are therefore used to gain a higher level of specificity than all selectors other than inline styles and '!important'.  
 
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
	All HTML elements 

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
	IDs can only be applied once within a document

    10. What is a class? 
	Class selectors are an attribute allowing you to target one element or many. They are the common attribute used for CSS.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
	All HTML element. 

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?
	However many times you want!
 
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
	Add the value '_blank' to the 'target' attribute of the <a> tag. 

    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
	The alt attribute is used to specify alternative text when an element, typically an element with image content, cannot be rendered.

    15. How do I reference an id?
	You reference an id using the pound sign, '#'.

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
	<section> tags are used semantically, whereas <div> tags are used presentationally. In other words, a <section> tag conveys meaning and a <div> tag conveys layout or styling.

    17. What is CSS used for? 
	Styling – or design attributes.

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
	Selecting an element is simple. You just write the name of the element. For example, in CSS you would select every h2 on the page by writing h2 { *styles go here* }.

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
	ID's are unique, with each element only having one ID and each page only having one element with that ID. On the contrary, classes are NOT unique and can be used on multiple elements with each element having multiple classes. You'll want to use a class for applying styles when they need to be applied to multiple objects on a page. An ID comes in handy when you want to select a specific element within the context of a script.
	

    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
	By using a full stop ('.').

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
	p.human

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
	The parent child selector (parent > child) selects all elements that are a direct child of the specified element. It would be useful when you want to apply styles to an element but not allow those styles to cascade further down to elements with the same class or tag. 

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
	div.sidebar a

    24. What is a pseudo selector?
	Pseudo selectors are a type of selector denoted with a colon (':') to define a special state of an element. For example, ':hover', ':active', ':focus', ':first-child', ':last-child', and ':nth-child'. 

    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
	Leading is adjusted using the 'line-height' CSS property. Little trick of the trade, 1.2 tends to look best across most typographic layouts. 

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
	Kerning (or tracking) is adjusted using the 'letter-spacing' CSS property. 

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
	The 'text-transform' CSS property can be set to 'uppercase', 'lowercase', or 'capitalize'. 

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
	Set the 'border' CSS property to '1px dotted #000'.

    29. How do I select everything on the page?

	The 'ls' command lists all files and folders in the current directory.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
	By using the 'rm' command. You must be careful when using this because once a file is deleted, it cannot be easily recovered. 
	
    34. Why should I use version control? 
	It keeps track of all changes made to files and allows us to work on projects simultaneously with a team. It allows you to undo or redo any changes you or a team member have made to a file without the creation of a new file.

    35. How often should I commit to github?
	You should commit to GitHub early and often.


    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
	git push -u <remote-repo-name> <branch-name>


    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
	Step 1: Fork - Create own version of the Repo
	Step 2: Collaborate - Add PM as a collaborator 
	Step 3: Clone - Clone the Repo
	Step 4: Branch - Create a branch named 'Jake-lazarus'; push to origin
	Step 5A: Submit a PR, and use your fork as base-fork and compare
	Step 5B: Add your PM as a reviewer
	Step 6: Complete - A PM will now accept the merge request after reviewing the code



Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	The way in which the element is displayed relative to other adjacent elements. A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, whereas an inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	The element's position is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties relative to the edges of the element's containing block. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	Apply the 'inline-block' value to the 'display' CSS property.
	

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	<div>, <li>, and <header> all default to block-level display. 
	<a> and <span> both default to display inline.
	<img> elements are display inline-block by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
	The box model defines every HTML element as an element wrapped with a box containing, from outside-in, margins, borders, padding and the actual content. The fix for the box model is the 'box-sizing: border-box' CSS property. This fix includes padding and borders in an element's width.
